And now a word from our sponsor...
----------------------------------

Thank you for trying out Translator. This plugin is very similar to another plugin
("Google Translator"), but I needed a slightly different UI (to create
quick and dirty resource files for other languages). Hopefully you'll find it useful as well.



Thanks,
Kurt Christensen
